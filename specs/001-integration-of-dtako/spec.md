# Feature Specification: dtako_mod Integration with ryohi_sub_cal2 Router

**Feature Branch**: `001-integration-of-dtako`  
**Created**: 2025-09-12  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Integration of dtako_mod submodule with ryohi_sub_cal2 router for importing production data from dtako_rows, dtako_events, and dtako_ferry tables"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Identified: dtako_mod submodule, ryohi_sub_cal2 router, production data import
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: system administrators, data consumers
   → Actions: import production data, route API requests
   → Data: dtako_rows, dtako_events, dtako_ferry
   → Constraints: production environment access, data consistency
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Marked production server details as needs clarification
   → Marked data synchronization frequency as needs clarification
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Defined import scenarios and data access flows
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement is testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities
   → Three main data entities identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   → WARN: Spec has uncertainties regarding production environment
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a system administrator, I need to import production data from dtako_rows, dtako_events, and dtako_ferry tables into a local system through the ryohi_sub_cal2 router, so that this data can be processed and analyzed without impacting the production environment.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** production data exists in dtako_rows table, **When** an import request is initiated with date range parameters, **Then** the specified data should be retrieved and stored locally
2. **Given** multiple event types exist in dtako_events, **When** filtering by specific event type, **Then** only matching events within the date range should be imported
3. **Given** ferry route data exists in production, **When** requesting data for a specific route, **Then** only ferry records for that route should be retrieved
4. **Given** imported data exists locally, **When** querying through the router endpoint, **Then** data should be returned without accessing production
5. **Given** an import is in progress, **When** checking import status, **Then** the system should report progress and any errors encountered

### Edge Cases
- What happens when production database is unavailable?
- How does system handle duplicate data during re-import?
- What occurs when date range spans more than [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum allowed period]?
- How are partial failures handled during bulk import?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide endpoints to import dtako_rows data from production environment
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide endpoints to import dtako_events data with optional event type filtering
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide endpoints to import dtako_ferry data with optional route filtering
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow date range specification for all import operations
- **FR-005**: System MUST store imported data locally to avoid repeated production queries
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide query endpoints for locally stored dtako_rows data
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide query endpoints for locally stored dtako_events data
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide query endpoints for locally stored dtako_ferry data
- **FR-009**: System MUST report import results including success count and errors
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle production database connection failures gracefully
- **FR-011**: System MUST prevent duplicate data imports using [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: deduplication strategy - primary key, timestamp, hash?]
- **FR-012**: Import operations MUST complete within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: performance requirement - 5 minutes, 30 minutes?]
- **FR-013**: System MUST authenticate with production database using [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: authentication method - credentials, certificate, token?]
- **FR-014**: Data synchronization MUST occur [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: frequency - on-demand only, scheduled, real-time?]

### Key Entities
- **dtako_rows**: Represents operational row data including vehicle information, driver codes, routes, distance, and fuel consumption tracked by date
- **dtako_events**: Represents system or operational events with timestamps, event types, vehicle and driver associations, descriptions, and optional location coordinates
- **dtako_ferry**: Represents ferry operation records including routes, departure/arrival times, passenger counts, and vehicle counts for specific dates
